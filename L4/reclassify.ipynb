    "# Data reclassification\n",
    "\n",
    "Reclassifying data based on specific criteria is a common task when doing GIS analysis. The purpose of this lesson is to see how we can reclassify values based on some criteria. We could, for example, classify information based on travel times and housing prices using these criteria:\n",

    "```\n",
    "1. if travel time to my work is less than 30 minutes\n",
