    "**Slope analysis** is a key terrain analysis technique used in GIS and spatial analysis to measure the steepness or incline of the terrain at any given point. It is calculated by examining the rate of change in elevation between neighboring pixels in a digital elevation model (DEM). Slope analysis helps identify areas with steep gradients, which is useful in applications like land-use planning, erosion risk assessment, hydrological modeling, and infrastructure development. The slope is typically expressed in degrees or as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can perform slope analysis anywhere, including on the Helsinki city center raster we worked with earlier. However, it will be more interesting to calculate it for an area with more elevation variation. Since Finland is generally quite flat, we need to look further north to find terrain that is more elevation-wise interesting for slope analysis. For this purpose, we are heading to [Ylläs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yll%C3%A4s) in Lapland, located in the northern part of Finland. Ylläs is a fell, or mountainous hill, and offers more diverse elevation changes, making it ideal for our slope analysis!\n",

It combines both the slope steepness and elevation of the terrain, providing an index that indicates the likelihood of a slope to remain stable. Steeper slopes and higher elevations tend to be more prone to instability, which can lead to phenomena such as landslides, rockfalls, or soil erosion.\n",
