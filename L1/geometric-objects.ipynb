    "Python has a specific module called [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) for doing various geometric operations. Basic knowledge of using Shapely is fundamental for understanding how geometries are stored and handled in GeoPandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric objects consist of coordinate tuples where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `Point` -object represents a single point in space. Points can be either two-dimensional (x, y) or three dimensional (x, y, z).\n",
    "-  `LineString` -object (i.e. a line) represents a sequence of points joined together to form a line. Hence, a line consist of a list of at least two coordinate tuples\n",
    "-  `Polygon` -object represents a filled area that consists of a list of at least three coordinate tuples that forms the outerior ring and a (possible) list of hole polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is also possible to have a collection of geometric objects (e.g. Polygons with multiple parts):**\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `MultiPoint` -object represents a collection of points and consists of a list of coordinate-tuples\n",
    "-  `MultiLineString` -object represents a collection of lines and consists of a list of line-like sequences\n",
    "-  `MultiPolygon` -object represents a collection of polygons that consists of a list of polygon-like sequences that construct from exterior ring and (possible) hole list tuples\n",
