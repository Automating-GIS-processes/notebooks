    "**Coordinate reference systems (CRS)** are important because the geometric shapes in a GeoDataFrame are simply a collection of coordinates in an arbitrary space. A CRS tells Python how those coordinates are related to places on the Earth. **A map projection** (or a projected coordinate system) is a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes into a plain surface where units are quite commonly represented as meters (instead of decimal degrees). This transformation is used to **represent the three dimensional earth on a flat, two dimensional map**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the CRS in different spatial datasets differ fairly often (i.e. one might have coordinates defined in decimal degrees while the other one has them in meters), it is a common procedure to **reproject** (transform) different layers into a common CRS. It is important that the layers are in the same coordinate reference system when analyzing the spatial relationships between the layers, for example, when making a Point in Polygon -query, or other type of overlay analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing an appropriate projection for your map is not always straightforward because it depends on what you actually want to represent with your map, and what is the spatial scale of your data. In fact, there is not a single \"perfect projection\" since each one of them has some strengths and weaknesses, and you should choose a projection that fits best for your needs. In fact, the projection you choose might even tell something about you!\n",
