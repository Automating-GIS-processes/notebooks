    "It is possible to do geocoding in Geopandas using its integrated functionalities of geopy. Geopandas has a function called ``geocode()``\n",

    "### Notes about Nominatim\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominatim works relatively nicely if you have well defined and well-known addresses such as the ones that we used in this tutorial. However, in some cases, you might not have such well-defined addresses, and you might have e.g. only the name of a museum available. In such cases, Nominatim might not provide such good results, and in such cases you might want to use e.g. [Google Geocoding API (V3)](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/). [Take a look from past year's materials where we show how to use Google Geocoding API](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/Lesson3-geocoding.html#geocoding-in-geopandas) in a similar manner as we used Nominatim here."
