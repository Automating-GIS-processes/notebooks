    "\n",
    "Nominatim works relatively nicely if you have well defined and well-known addresses such as the ones that we used in this tutorial. In practice, the address needs to exist in the OpenStreetMap database. Sometimes, however, you might want to geocode a \"point-of-interest\", such as a museum, only based on it's name. If the museum name is not on OpenStreetMap, Nominatim won't provide any results for it, but you might be able to geocode the place using some other geocoder such as the [Google Geocoding API (V3)](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/), which requires an API key. [Take a look from past year's materials where we show how to use Google Geocoding API](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/Lesson3-geocoding.html#geocoding-in-geopandas) in a similar manner as we used Nominatim here."
