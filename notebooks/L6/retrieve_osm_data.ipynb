    "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global collaborative (crowd-sourced) dataset and project that aims at creating a free editable map of the world containing a lot of information about our environment.\n",
    "It contains data for example about streets, buildings, different services, and landuse to mention a few. You can view the map at www.openstreetmap.org. You can also sign up as a contributor if you want to edit the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSM has a large userbase with more than 4 million users and over a million contributers that update actively the OSM database with 3 million changesets per day. In total OSM contains 5 billion nodes that form the basis of the digitally mapped world that OSM provides ([stats from November 2019](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats)).\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap is used not only for integrating the **OSM maps** as background maps to visualizations or online maps, but also for many other purposes such as **routing**, **geocoding**, **education**, and **research**. OSM is also widely used for humanitarian response e.g. in crisis areas (e.g. after natural disasters) and for fostering economic development (see more from [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) website](https://www.hotosm.org)).\n"
