    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global collaborative (crowd-sourced) dataset and project that aims at creating a free editable map of the world containing a lot of information about our environment.\n",
    "It contains data for example about streets, buildings, different services, and landuse to mention a few. You can view the map at www.openstreetmap.org. You can also sign up as a contributor if you want to edit the map. More details about OpenStreetMap and its contents are available in the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page).\n",
    "\n",
    "OSM has a large userbase with more than 4 million users and over a million contributers that update actively the OSM database with 3 million changesets per day. In total OSM contains 5 billion nodes and counting! ([stats from November 2019](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats)).\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStreetMap is used not only for integrating the **OSM maps** as background maps to visualizations or online maps, but also for many other purposes such as **routing**, **geocoding**, **education**, and **research**. OSM is also widely used for humanitarian response e.g. in crisis areas (e.g. after natural disasters) and for fostering economic development. Read more about humanitarian projects that use OSM data from the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOTOSM) website](https://www.hotosm.org).\n"
