    "# Exploring raster data in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data consists of rows and columns of cells or pixels, with each cell representing a single value. This type of data is often thought of as images, although raster datasets can be stored in various formats such as **ASCII text files** or **Binary Large Objects (BLOBs)** within databases.\n",

    "Raster data represents the world as a grid of equally sized cells or pixels, where each cell has a value representing information, such as temperature, elevation, or land cover. There are two primary ways of working with raster data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single-band raster: Each pixel has one value (e.g., elevation or temperature).\n",
    "- Multiband raster: Each pixel has multiple values (e.g., Red, Green, and Blue bands in satellite imagery).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key characterestic of any raster data is its **Resolution**. Resolution refers to the ground distance that each cell represents. For example, if the resolution is two meters, each cell corresponds to an area two meters by two meters. A raster dataset with higher resolution can show more detail, but it will also have larger file sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster data can be stored in a variety of **formats**, some of the more common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)**: This is the most common geospatial raster format due to its flexibility. It allows for storage of multiple bands, metadata, and internal compression. However, TIFF files can sometimes be incompatible across software.\n",
    "- **JPEG, GIF, BMP, PNG**: These formats are more suitable for images used in presentations or online applications. While common, they are not as robust for storing geospatial data due to lack of metadata support.\n",
    "- **ASCII Grid**: This format is often used for storing elevation data as simple text files, with spatial information stored in a header."

    "- [`rioxarray`](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/): An extension of `xarray` designed for geospatial raster data operations. It builds on top of `rasterio` to handle reading and writing raster formats like GeoTIFF, working with CRS (Coordinate Reference Systems), and performing GIS-specific tasks like reprojection. This combination allows for easy manipulation of spatial data in a highly efficient manner.\n",
    "- [`xarray-spatial`](https://xarray-spatial.org/): A high-performance spatial analysis library that works with `xarray` to perform raster-based spatial analysis tasks such as terrain analysis, focal operations, and zonal statistics. It is designed for fast processing of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries are closely related to **`rasterio`**, which is the core library for handling raster data formats. [`rasterio`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is built on the GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) and provides efficient, low-level input and output operations for raster data, supporting various formats like GeoTIFF, PNG, and JPEG. It allows you to read and write raster files, access pixel values, manage CRS, and perform raster data manipulation.\n",
