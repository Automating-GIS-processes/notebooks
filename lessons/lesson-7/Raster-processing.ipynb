    "> #### Basic Syntax\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> np.where(condition, x, y)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> - **`condition`**: A boolean array or condition that’s checked for each element.\n",
    "> - **`x`**: The value (or array) to use when the condition is `True`.\n",
    "> - **`y`**: The value (or array) to use when the condition is `False`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For each element, if the `condition` is `True`, `np.where` returns the corresponding value from `x`; otherwise, it returns the corresponding value from `y`.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### Example\n",
    "> Here's a simple example to clarify how it works:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> import numpy as np\n",
    ">\n",
    "> arr = np.array([1, -2, 3, -4, 5])\n",

    "> ```\n",
    "> **Output:**\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> In this case:\n",
    "> - The condition `arr > 0` checks if each element is positive.\n",
    "> - Where the condition is `True` (for positive numbers), `np.where` returns the original `arr` value.\n",
    "> - Where the condition is `False` (for negative numbers), it returns `0`.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### Practical Uses\n",
    "> `np.where` is often used for:\n",
    "> - **Masking values** in an array (e.g., setting invalid values to NaN).\n",
    "> - **Conditional selection** in data processing and filtering.\n",
    "> - **Replacing values** in an array based on certain conditions."

    "## Slope analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slope analysis** is a key terrain analysis technique used in GIS and spatial analysis to measure the steepness or incline of the terrain at any given point. It is calculated by examining the rate of change in elevation between neighboring pixels in a digital elevation model (DEM). Slope analysis helps identify areas with steep gradients, which is useful in applications like land-use planning, erosion risk assessment, hydrological modeling, and infrastructure development. The slope is typically expressed in degrees or as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can perform slope analysis anywhere, including on the Helsinki city center raster we worked with earlier. However, for this course's purpose, it will be more interesting to calculate it for an area with more elevation variation. Since Finland is generally quite flat, we need to look further north to find terrain that is more elevation-wise interesting for slope analysis. For this purpose, we are heading to [Ylläs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yll%C3%A4s) in Lapland, located in the northern part of Finland. Ylläs is a fell, or mountainous hill, and offers more diverse elevation changes, making it ideal for our slope analysis!\n",

To avoid this, use `.load()` to force immediate data loading and minimize reliance on deferred operations."
