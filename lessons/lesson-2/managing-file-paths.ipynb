    "# Managing file paths\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with data, it is important to keep track of where which input\n",
    "files are stored, and where which output files should be written. This is\n",
    "especially important when moving between computers or between virtual machines,\n",
    "like, for instance, the CSC Notebooks platform. Using a distributed code\n",
    "repository or versioning system, such as GitHub, adds another layer of\n",
    "complexity: file paths should often be *relative* to the git repo, or to the\n",
    "current file, as the repository can be cloned to any location on a different\n",
    "computer (and already a different user name on your school and personal\n",
    "computers might break things).\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, file paths have often been hard-coded strings, text values. If, for\n",
    "instance, an output file name had to be derived from an input file name, all\n",
    "kind of slicing and other string manipulation methods would be used. More\n",
    "recently, the `os.path` module of Python became popular, that allowed to split\n",
    "a path into directories, and file names into base names and file extensions.\n",
    "However, manipulating file paths still required knowledge about the computer a\n",
    "script would ultimately run on. For instance, on all Unix-based operating\n",
    "systems, such as Linux or MacOS, directories are separated by forward-slashes\n",
    "(`/`), while Microsoft Windows uses back-slashes (`\\`) (this particular problem\n",
    "can be worked around with `os.sep` and `os.path.join`, but not in a very\n",
    "convenient way). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python 3.4 (so, fairly recently), there exists a built-in module that\n",
    "eases much of the hassle with managing file paths:\n",
    "[`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html). It provides an\n",
    "abstract layer on top of the actual operating system file paths that is\n",
    "consistent across computers. A `pathlib.Path()` object can be initiated with a\n",
    "file path (as a `str`), when created without an argument, it refers to the\n",
    "directory of the script or notebook file."
