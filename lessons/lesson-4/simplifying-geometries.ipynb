    "something to consider for example when you have very detailed spatial features\n",
    "that cover the whole world. If you make a map that covers the whole world, it\n",
    "is unnecessary to have really detailed geometries because it is simply\n",
    "impossible to see those small details from your map. Furthermore, it takes a\n",
