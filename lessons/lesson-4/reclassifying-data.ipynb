    "# Reclassifying data\n",
    "\n",
    "Reclassifying data based on specific criteria is a common task when doing GIS\n",
    "analysis. The purpose of this lesson is to see how we can reclassify values\n",
    "based on some criteria. We could, for example, classify information based on\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if travel time to my work is less than 30 minutes, **AND**\n",
    "2. the rent of the apartment is less than 1000 â‚¬ per month\n",

    "If both criteria are met: I go to see the appartment and try to rent it\n",
    "If not: I continue to look for something else\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Use classification schemes from the PySAL [mapclassify\n",
    "   library](https://pysal.org/mapclassify/) to classify travel times into\n",
    "   multiple classes.\n",

    "2. Create a custom classifier to classify travel times and distances in order\n",
    "   to find out good locations to buy an apartment with these conditions:\n",
